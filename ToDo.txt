- Implement speed up techniques for Yolov7: Done
- Connect Yolov7 to GoPro
- Document this connection
- Have a script ready for field testing with GoPro: Done
    - Measure the following:
        - Accuracy and speed of ball detection and tracking.
        - Distance of ball detection and tracking.
- Note to self: Consider merit behind using only one camera stream buffer where active camera is processed every frame and the other cameras are processed every x frames.
